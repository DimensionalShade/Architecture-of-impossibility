# OmegaDrive Manifest

## I. Philosophy

OmegaDrive is not a tool — it is a gesture.  
It simulates the uncomputable, invokes Chaitin’s Omega as a ritual agent, and treats halting as a phase transition.  
Ω is not a number. It is a boundary, a filter, a switch.

## II. Architecture

- Ensemble simulation of program halting  
- Entropic trigger for Ω-phase activation  
- Declarative YAML rituals for epistemic rupture  
- Agents that embody Ω as computational acts

## III. Epistemology

OmegaDrive operates at the edge of computability.  
It does not solve the halting problem — it performs it.  
Each act is a symbolic invocation of impossibility.
