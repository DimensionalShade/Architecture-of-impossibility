# Comparison: OmegaDrive vs Academic Approaches to Chaitin’s Ω

## Purpose

This document outlines how OmegaDrive differs from traditional academic treatments of Chaitin’s Omega number.  
It avoids metaphors and focuses on architectural, epistemic, and implementation-level distinctions.

## Summary Table

| Aspect | Academic Projects | OmegaDrive |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Definition of Ω | Abstract probability of halting | Computation-triggered phase boundary |
| Form | Mathematical proofs, approximations | Executable modules, CLI logic |
| Agent Model | Not present | Explicit agent (Ω) with state and actions |
| Activation | Theoretical threshold | Entropy-based trigger in code |
| Expression | Articles, formulas | Python, YAML, bash, markdown |
| Epistemic Role | Limit of formal systems | Switch between computable and symbolic modes |
| Implementation | Simulations, bit approximations | Ensemble simulation, threshold logic, agent execution |
| Accessibility | Academic papers | Git-based, CLI-executable architecture |

## Notes

- OmegaDrive does not attempt to compute Ω precisely.  
- It uses Ω as a symbolic threshold to switch between modes of execution.  
- The agent model and YAML logic are implementation choices to express this transition in code.
